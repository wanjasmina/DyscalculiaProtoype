<h1> MathIsFun - Adaptive Learning App for Students with Dyscalculia </h1>
MathIsFun is an adaptive mobile application designed to support students with dyscalculia in learning mathematics more effectively. This project consists of 4 modules and mine is focused on developing an Intelligent Module, which features an AI scanner to assist users when they struggle with solving problems.
<br />

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Before developing the prototype, we conducted a survey via Google Forms to gather feedback on potential improvements for the MathIsFun app. Based on the responses, we refined our design, ensuring it aligned with user needs. Additionally, we researched existing dyscalculia apps and explored design inspirations from Pinterest and Google to enhance the user experience.
<br />

<h2>Design & Evaluation</h2>
Our prototype was developed in compliance with Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design, and a design evaluation confirmed that most respondents strongly agreed with its effectiveness.
